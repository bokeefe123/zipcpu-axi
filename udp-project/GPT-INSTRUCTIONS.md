1. Understand the AXI Protocols Relevant to UDP Packet Processing
Action Steps:

Study AXI4-Stream Protocol:

Key Signals:
TVALID: Indicates that the master is driving valid data.
TREADY: Indicates that the slave is ready to receive data.
TDATA: The data bus (typically 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits wide).
TLAST: Indicates the last transfer in a packet.
TKEEP (optional): Byte qualifiers for partial transfers.
Handshaking Mechanism:
Data transfer occurs when both TVALID and TREADY are asserted.
Packetization:
Use TLAST to signify the end of a UDP packet.
Resources:

ARM AMBA Specifications: Download the AXI4-Stream Protocol Specification.
Tutorials:

3. Learn Verilog Essentials for Packet Processing
Action Steps:

Review Basic Constructs:

Modules and Ports: Define input and output ports for your modules.
Data Types: Use wire for combinational signals and reg for sequential logic.
Procedural Blocks: Use always blocks for sequential logic and assign statements for combinational logic.
Understand Control Structures:

Use if, else, and case statements to handle different conditions, such as parsing various header fields.
Practice with Small Examples:

Preamble, Destination MAC, Source MAC, Ethertype, Payload, CRC.
IP Header Structure:
Version, Header Length, Total Length, Protocol, Source IP, Destination IP, etc.
UDP Header Structure:
Source Port, Destination Port, Length, Checksum.
Familiarize with Packet Fields:

Identify which fields are essential for your application (e.g., source/destination IP and port numbers).
Analyze Sample Packets:

Use tools like Wireshark to capture and inspect UDP packets.
Resources:

RFC Documents:
RFC 768 for UDP.
RFC 791 for IP.
Goal: Understand the structure of UDP packets to correctly parse and manipulate them in your design.

5. Design the UDP Packet Processor Module
Action Steps:

Define Module Interface:

AXI Stream Input:
s_axis_tvalid, s_axis_tready, s_axis_tdata, s_axis_tlast, s_axis_tkeep.
AXI Stream Output:
m_axis_tvalid, m_axis_tready, m_axis_tdata, m_axis_tlast, m_axis_tkeep.
Control Signals (Optional):
Configuration registers for encryption keys or parameters via AXI4-Lite.
Decide on Functionality:

Packet Recognition:
Detect UDP packets based on protocol field in the IP header.
Match specific source/destination ports if needed.
Encryption/Decryption:
Apply encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) to the UDP payload.
Ensure the encryption process fits within the data throughput requirements.
Implement Packet Parsing Logic:

State Machine Design:
Use a finite state machine (FSM) to track the parsing process.
States may include IDLE, ETH_HEADER, IP_HEADER, UDP_HEADER, PAYLOAD, etc.
Header Extraction:
Extract necessary header fields as the packet data streams in.
Use shift registers or counters to keep track of byte positions.
Handle Payload Processing:

Encryption/Decryption Module:
Implement or integrate an encryption core compatible with your design.
Ensure it operates at the required data rate.
Data Buffering:
Use FIFOs if necessary to buffer data between parsing and encryption stages.
Goal: Design a Verilog module that can recognize, encrypt, or decrypt UDP packets in an AXI Stream data flow.

6. Implement the AXI Stream Interfaces
Action Steps:

AXI Stream Input Interface (s_axis_ signals):

Handle incoming data packets, asserting s_axis_tready when ready to receive data.
Use s_axis_tkeep to handle partial bytes if your data width is more than 8 bits.
AXI Stream Output Interface (m_axis_ signals):

Output processed packets, asserting m_axis_tvalid when data is valid.
Use m_axis_tlast to indicate the end of a packet.
Flow Control:

Implement back-pressure handling by de-asserting s_axis_tready if the module cannot accept more data.
Stall processing if m_axis_tready is not asserted by the downstream module.
Data Width Considerations:

Choose an appropriate TDATA width (e.g., 8, 16, 32 bits) based on your application requirements.
Align data correctly, considering byte ordering (big-endian or little-endian).
Goal: Ensure proper data flow and handshaking between your module and other AXI Stream components.

7. Develop Testbenches with Verilator
Action Steps:

Set Up the Testbench Environment:

Top-Level Testbench Module:
Instantiate your UDP packet processor module.
